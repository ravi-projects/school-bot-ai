At present the system adopted by all the scientists in the world is,MKS,CGS,FPS,SI,SI
The number of fundamental physical quantities in SI is,2,5,3,7,7
"Among the following, the supplementary physical quantities in SI are
 i) Luminous Intensity ii) Plane angle iii) Area iv) Solid angle","i, ii and iii only",ii and iii only,"ii, iii and iv only",ii and iv only,ii and iv only
Relation between numerical value (N) of a physical quantity and its magnitude of unit (U) is,N ∝ U,N ∝ 1/U,N² ∝ 1/U,N ∝ 1/U²,N ∝ 1/U²
Property of a unit is,Invariability,Consistency,Reproducibility,All the above,All the above
The mass of a boat is PQ in one system and the mass of the same boat is RS in another system. P and R are numerical values and Q and S are units.,PQ ≠ RS,PQ = RS,both a and b are correct,Neither a nor b are correct,PQ = RS
"If U1 , U2 are units of physical quantities, N1, N2 are their numerical values then",N1/N2 = U1/U2,N1/N2 = U2/U1,N1/N2 = √(U2/U1),(N1/N2)² = U1/U2,N1/N2 = U1/U2
